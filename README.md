# projeto-adote
In this project i'm creating an api to register and search dogs for adoption, by using Python + Django and Pillow libraries.

First, i started the project Adote by creating the application named as "usu√°rios". This app has the purpose to receive the datas by the user to use it to creat a new user, login and logout.

Then, was time to make an application to help the user to register their pets for adoption. It name is "divulgar'.
